[Changes for 0.15 - 2008-06-27]

* Fix infinite recursion on UNIVERSAL methods used as class methods on
  Scalar::Defer::Deferred itself.
  http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=37153

[Changes for 0.14 - 2008-01-09]

* Avoid harmless '(in cleanup)' warnings caused by Class::InsideOut's
  DESTROY method.

* Mention Data::Thunk, a sneakier XS-based implementation of lazy{}.

[Changes for 0.13 - 2008-01-01]

* New exportable function 'is_deferred'.

* Minor code cleanup: removing unused import
  and constants.

[Changes for 0.12 - 2007-12-18]

* Fixed major memory leak caused by defer{} and lazy{}, by cleaning out
  the local storage when the InsideOut object goes away.

[Changes for 0.11 - 2007-11-26]

* Refactored internals for the upcoming (optional) support for
  UNIVERSAL::ref instead of blessing into the "0" package.
  Contributed by: Matt S Trout

[Changes for 0.10 - 2007-03-16]

* Recover gracefully after the Perl runtime reallocates
  lazy value's pointer address.
  Reported by: Yves Agostini

* Much more improved error message when a thunk cannot be located.

[Changes for 0.07 - 2006-07-21]

* Updated internals to work with Pel 5.9.x.
  Suggested by: Rafael Garcia-Suarez

[Changes for 0.06 - 2006-07-20]

* Inhibit redefinition warning when Scalar::Defer is loaded twice.

* Comment and syntax cleanup.

[Changes for 0.05 - 2006-07-19]

* Calling methods on a deferred value now works correctly.

* Deferred values are now blessed into the "0" package, which means
  Scalar::Util::blessed() and ref() will both return false on them.

* The ->force method is now replaced by an exported "force"
  function instead.

[Changes for 0.04 - 2006-07-19]

* Document the ->force method for getting a normal value out of a
  deferred value.
  Requested by: Nathan Gray

[Changes for 0.03 - 2006-07-17]

* Documentation cleanup; no functional changes.

[Changes for 0.02 - 2006-07-17]

* Changed name from Data::Thunk to Scalar::Defer, per suggestion
  from obra++, mstrout++ and gaal++.
  
* The "thunk" function is gone; "lazy" is now the memoizing
  variant of "defer".

[Changes for 0.01 - 2006-07-17]

* Initial CPAN release.
