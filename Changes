[Changes for 0.06 - 2006-07-20]

* Inhibit redefinition warning when Scalar::Defer is loaded twice.

* Comment and syntax cleanup.

[Changes for 0.05 - 2006-07-19]

* Calling methods on a deferred value now works correctly.

* Deferred values are now blessed into the "0" package, which means
  Scalar::Util::blessed() and ref() will both return false on them.

* The ->force method is now replaced by an exported "force"
  function instead.

[Changes for 0.04 - 2006-07-19]

* Document the ->force method for getting a normal value out of a
  deferred value.

* Documentation cleanup; no functional changes.

[Changes for 0.02 - 2006-07-17]

* Changed name from Data::Thunk to Scalar::Defer, per suggestion

* The "thunk" function is gone; "lazy" is now the memoizing
  variant of "defer".
